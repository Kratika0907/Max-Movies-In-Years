# Max-Movies-In-Years

Max-years => Steps followed 

Sorted the given response 
Built map based on  increment and decrement of movies
Built cummulative map and then find global maxima and local minima to get interval
Perpare set based on obtained interval

Time complexity = O(nlogn) where n will be the elements in array
Space complexity = O((Ymax-Ymin))

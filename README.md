# Max-Movies-In-Years

Max-Movies-In-Years-3 => 

Time Complexity = O(nlogn) where n is the number of elements in response array 

Space Complexity = we have used auxillary array to store the year answer array which will take space in worse case O(maxYear - minYear)


Max-Movies-In-Years-2 =>  

Time Complexity = O(nlogn) where n is the number of element in years array

Space Complexity = O(maxyears-minyear) => map and array
